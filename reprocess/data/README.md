# Folder description

This folder serves as the default storage location for the contents of two types of repositories:

1. User-specified repositories, located in the `./downloads/*` directory.
2. Test-related repositories, located in the `./tests/*` directory.

---

Each repository is organized within a subfolder that bears the same name as the repository.

For instance, if the repository `https://github.com/kezouke/TestGena` is downloaded, it will be stored in the subfolder `./downloads/TestGena/`.
